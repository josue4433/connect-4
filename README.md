Connect Four Game
This project is an implementation of the classic game Connect Four. The game allows two players to take turns dropping colored pieces into a 7x6 grid, with the goal of connecting four pieces in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Installation
To run this project, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

You will also need to install the Pygame library, which can be installed using pip:

Copy code
pip install pygame
Usage
To start the game, simply run the connect_four.py file using Python:

Copy code
python connect_four.py
The game will open in a new window, and you can start playing by clicking on a column to drop your piece. The game will automatically switch between the two players after each turn. If a player wins, a message will appear announcing the winner, and you can start a new game by clicking the "New Game" button. You can quit the game at any time by clicking the "Quit" button.

Game Rules
The rules of Connect Four are simple:

Players take turns dropping their colored pieces into a 7x6 grid.
Pieces fall to the lowest available position in the column they are dropped in.
The first player to connect four pieces of their color in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
If the board fills up without a winner, the game is a tie.
Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

connect_four.py: the main game file, which handles the game mechanics and user interface.
board.py: a module that defines the Board class, which represents the game board.
piece.py: a module that defines the Piece class, which represents the colored game pieces.
utils.py: a module that defines some utility functions used by the other modules.
Future Improvements
Here are some possible improvements that could be made to this project:

Add an AI opponent, so that players can play against the computer.
Implement a difficulty level setting for the AI opponent.
Add sound effects and music to make the game more immersive.
Implement an online multiplayer mode, so that players can play against each other remotely.
